# AnnaBellaDB

AnnaBellaDB is a proof-of-concept (PoC) network latency and access-pattern aware key-value store. In our opinion, this solution is ideal to adapt the stateless design and use AnnaBellaDB as a cloud database where the application states could be externalized.

This PoC have been forked from one of the most effective key-value store from the academy, called AnnaDB which was developed in in the [RISE Lab](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu) at [UC Berkeley](https://berkeley.edu).
